## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow Python best practices and PEP 8 guidelines:

- **Use Black** for code formatting: `black .`
- **Use isort** for import sorting: `isort .`
- **Use flake8** for linting: `flake8 .`
- **Maximum line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **Use type hints** where appropriate
- **Write comprehensive docstrings** for all functions and classes

### Code Quality Standards

- **Write clean, readable code** with meaningful variable names
- **Add comprehensive docstrings** for all public functions
- **Include error handling** for all external API calls
- **Add logging** for important operations and errors
- **Follow security best practices** (input validation, secure defaults)
- **Write unit tests** for new functionality
- **Update documentation** for API changes

### Git Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect code meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add new webhook endpoint for real-time analysis
fix(ui): resolve mobile responsive layout issues
docs(readme): add deployment instructions
refactor(ai): optimize prompt engineering for better accuracy
```

### Testing

- **Write tests** for all new functionality
- **Ensure tests pass** before submitting PR
- **Include integration tests** for API endpoints
- **Test error handling** scenarios
- **Test with different data formats**

Run tests with:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Documentation

- **Update README.md** if adding new features
